#Title
Model measurement comparison of organic aerosol measurements over West Africa.

#Introduction 
We present measurements of SOA from aircraft over West Africa.
J.Bloggs et al already took some measurements there but they havent answered all the scientific questions.
Ofcourse, J.Smith et al made some great measurements in the 1980s in this region. 

#Simulations
John as a greta model which simulates particle formation from forest fire emissions.
